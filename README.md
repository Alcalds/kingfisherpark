# Kingfisher Park — Homepage V1

This package is the first meaningful VS Code homepage prototype based on the approved **Kingfisher Park Master Development Prompt V2**.

## Included in this checkpoint

1. Header V2 using the official Kingfisher Park logo
2. Hero V1 using the current provisional aerial mangrove image
3. Custom firefly-inspired Canvas animation
4. Visit at a Glance / visitor snapshot
5. Initial Choose Your Experience preview with the current September 2026 rates

The rest of the homepage is intentionally not built yet. The next sections should only be added after this visual direction is reviewed.

## Open in VS Code

1. Extract this folder.
2. Open `kingfisher-park-homepage-v1` in VS Code.
3. Open `index.html` with Live Server.
4. Review first at **1600px desktop width**.
5. Also test 1024px, 768px, 430px, 390px and 360px widths.

## Current content status

### HISTORICAL / PROVISIONAL ASSET NOTE
The kayaking photograph comes from the older Kingfisher Park asset package and is used only to demonstrate the current kayaking activity in this prototype. It does not represent a current renovated facility.

New renovated park/facility photographs remain pending and should replace temporary or outdated facility imagery when supplied.

## Firefly effect

The fireflies are a decorative interface animation, not documentary wildlife footage or a representation of actual firefly density. The implementation:

- uses native HTML Canvas + vanilla JavaScript
- reduces particle count on smaller screens
- respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- pauses animation when the page/tab is hidden or the Hero is off-screen
- keeps particles biased toward the image side so the main Hero copy stays readable

## Booking

Buttons intentionally do not process bookings yet. They show a prototype notice. The complete simulated booking flow belongs to Stage 4 of the approved development plan.


## Stage 2 additions

Homepage V2 preserves the approved Header/Hero/firefly/visit snapshot foundation and adds:

- Full experience section polish
- A Living Mangrove Landscape
- Biodiversity archive gallery
- Day-to-Night transition
- After Dark experience story

The next stage remains:
- Conservation & Community
- Stories / History preview
- Know Before You Go
- Plan Your Visit
- Booking CTA
- Footer

Booking/payment itself remains reserved for Stage 4.


## Stage 3 additions

Homepage V3 completes the lower half of the homepage prototype:

- Conservation & Community
- Stories & History preview
- Know Before You Go
- Plan Your Visit
- Booking CTA / booking-flow preview
- Footer

The current homepage is now structurally complete enough for a full visual review.

### Next stage

Build the **interactive booking prototype**:

`Experience → Date → Time → Guests → Details → Review → Demo Payment → Confirmation`

No real payment will be processed in VS Code.


## Interactive Booking Prototype — V1

A fully interactive VS Code booking prototype has now been added at:

`booking.html`

Flow:

`Experience → Date & Time Status → Guests → Guest Details → Review → Demo Payment → Confirmation`

### Important prototype safeguards

- Current September 2026 per-person rates are used.
- Exact time slots are **not invented**. The prototype records the time as pending Kingfisher Park confirmation.
- No child, senior/PWD, resident, group, or capacity rule is invented.
- No cancellation, refund, rescheduling, no-show, payment fee, or provider rule is invented.
- No real payment credentials are requested.
- The Demo Payment step only simulates a successful transaction.
- The generated booking reference begins with `KP-DEMO-`.
- The confirmation can be printed/saved as a browser PDF for review.

### Homepage integration

All Book Now / Book / Book Your Experience actions now open the interactive booking prototype. Experience-card booking links preselect the relevant experience.


## Responsive Refinement — V2

This version keeps the approved Homepage V3 and Booking V1 functionality, then adds a focused responsive/accessibility pass:

- Mobile sticky **Book Your Experience** CTA on the homepage
- Larger mobile touch targets
- Tighter mobile hero and section spacing
- Improved small-screen experience cards
- Compact mobile booking step/total status
- Improved booking form typography on mobile
- Improved live-summary behavior on tablet/mobile
- Explicit demo-payment disclaimer
- Brief simulated checkout state
- `aria-live` updates for booking summary/status
- No new rates, schedules, booking rules, or policies were invented

See `docs/RESPONSIVE_QA.md` for the current QA checklist.


## Multi-page Architecture — V1

The homepage has been intentionally reduced to **7 primary sections**:

1. Hero
2. Visit at a Glance
3. Featured Experiences
4. Living Mangrove Landscape
5. Biodiversity Preview
6. After Dark
7. Booking CTA

Detailed content now has dedicated HTML pages:

- `the-park.html`
- `experiences.html`
- `biodiversity.html`
- `stories.html`
- `plan-your-visit.html`
- `booking.html`

This keeps the homepage focused on discovery and conversion while giving detailed content room to breathe.


## Living Light Hero — V1

The standard tourism Hero has been replaced with an interactive Kingfisher Park-specific **Living Light Hero**.

Visitors can move through:

`DAYLIGHT → GOLDEN HOUR → AFTER DARK`

The Hero uses authentic Kingfisher Park imagery and connects the firefly animation to the active time-of-day state rather than showing full fireflies all the time.

The homepage biodiversity area has also been reduced to a four-image preview, with full material remaining on `biodiversity.html`.
